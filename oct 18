Need to replace the raspberry pico with a cheap arduino
Arduino can take max 5 V so regulator can be max 5V lowk?
Screen runs on 3.2-3.6 V, so arduino can output 3.3V from the board directly, through the on board voltage regulator!
Arduino Nano Every can also output 5 V from usb connection?!
Another option is Arduino Nano R4
needs to tolerate more than 500mA

TO DO
- Add arduino nano every to schematic and connect to screen
In new project folder
Battery connector (added component into rsx_headers)
On/off button
*coco will add the schematic symbol for the on/off button 


Next steps: turn into PCB
